# Poker hands
## [Problem 54](https://projecteuler.net/problem=54)
In the card game poker, a hand consists of five cards and are ranked, from lowest to highest, in the following way:
The cards are valued in the order:
2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, Jack, Queen, King, Ace.

If two players have the same ranked hands then the rank made up of the highest value wins; for example, a pair of eights beats a pair of fives (see example 1 below). But if two ranks tie, for example, both players have a pair of queens, then highest cards in each hand are compared (see example 4 below); if the highest cards tie then the next highest cards are compared, and so on.
Consider the following five hands dealt to two players:

Hand | Player 1 | Player 2 | Winner
1 | 5H 5C 6S 7S KDPair of Fives | 2C 3S 8S 8D TDPair of Eights | Player 2

The file, [poker.txt](project/resources/p054_poker.txt), contains one-thousand random hands dealt to two players. Each line of the file contains ten cards (separated by a single space): the first five are Player 1's cards and the last five are Player 2's cards. You can assume that all hands are valid (no invalid characters or repeated cards), each player's hand is in no specific order, and in each hand there is a clear winner.
How many hands does Player 1 win?
