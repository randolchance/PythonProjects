## [Problem 40](https://projecteuler.net/problem=40)
An irrational decimal fraction is created by concatenating the positive integers:
0.123456789101112131415161718192021...
It can be seen that the 12^th digit of the fractional part is 1.
If d_n represents the n^th digit of the fractional part, find the value of the following expression.
d_1 × d_10 × d_100 × d_1000 × d_10000 × d_100000 × d_1000000
