A Dumping Ground for Random Junk I Made in Python

## Root
The root directory is populated with libraries I've made to perform fairly routine functions, primarily mathematical ones for Project Euler problems.
Some classes were made just for kicks.

## PracticeProblems
I've lost the link, but these are solutions to extremely simple practice problems highlighting various features of Python

## ProjectEulerSolutions
Random assortment of problems taken from [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net).
